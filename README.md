# 🧠 Memory Game

A simple yet engaging card-matching memory game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## 🎯 Features

* Flip cards to reveal symbols and find matching pairs.
* Tracks number of moves and elapsed time.
* Optionally tracks and displays high scores (if implemented).
* Clean, responsive UI design.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
/
├── index.html       # Game layout
├── style.css        # Game styling
└── script.js        # Core game logic (shuffle, flip, match, scoring)
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

All you need is a modern web browser—no installation required!

### Usage

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jenniferlinet/memory-game.git
   cd memory-game
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Start playing! Click on cards to reveal and match them.

## 🛠️ How It Works

* **Card Grid**: Cards are shuffled and displayed face-down.
* **Game Loop**:

  1. Click two cards.
  2. If symbols match, the cards stay revealed; otherwise, they flip back after a brief pause.
  3. The game finishes when all pairs are matched.
* **Score Tracking**: Monitors moves (pair attempts) and time. High scores can be added with local storage or server integration.

## ♻️ Customization & Extension

* To change card icons/images: update `cards` array in `script.js`.
* Add new features like level difficulty, sound effects, or persistent high score tracking.
* Refactor the code into ES6 modules or integrate into a front-end framework for scalability.

* Bug reports or feature requests via issues.
